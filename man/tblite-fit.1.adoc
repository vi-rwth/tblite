== Name
tblite-fit - Optimize tight-binding parameters

== Synopsis
*tblite fit* [_options_] _param_ _input_


== Description

Takes the name of the starting parameter file as first positional argument and an input file for the settings of the run as second positional argument.
A starting parameter file can be produced using the tblite-param(1) command.


== Input file

The input file is provided in TOML format it contains the input to the optimization algorithm and the setup for the evaluation of the data set.

|_table_
|===

The _mask_ table allows to select which parameters are part of the fit.
Generally, all keys that take real values can be toggled in the mask.
To enable a parameter group in the _element_ records, add the respective table name.
Possible parameter groups are _hamiltonian_, _dispersion_, _repulsion_, _halogen_, _charge_, _thirdorder_, and _multipole_.
Only elements present in the _element_ table will be included in the fit.
Individual entries can be toggled by adding their key to the subtable.


=== Example

Settings for fitting carbon and hydrogen parameters, the slater exponent of the halogen atom is kept fixed to starting value.

== Script

To make the fitting procedure flexible, the module will not attempt evaluate data sets itself but invoke a user provided script.
The user provided script line is run for each fit iteration.
Before invoking the script the module will emit the current parametrization data to the file provided in _param-file_.
After the iteration the module will read the reference data and actual data from the file specified in _data-file_.
The objective function is calculated as root mean square deviation from all entries in the data file.

=== Environment variables

The script will get information about the current run passed by environment variables.

*TBLITE_EXE*::
     Path to the tblite(1) executable
*TBLITE_OUT*::
     Name of the data file which will be read by the optimizer to determine the objective function
*TBLITE_PAR*::
     Name of the file containing the current set of parameters.
     This file must be read by the program used to evaluate the tight-binding method.


== Options

*--dry-run*::
     Do not run start the fitting procedure

*--copy* _file_::
     Write the full representation of the input to _file_, all defaults will be filled in and the mask expanded.

*-v, --verbose*::
     Increase verbosity of printout

*-s, --silent*::
     Reduce verbosity of printout

*--version*::
     Prints version number and citation

*--help*::
     Show this message


Command line arguments can be read from an indirect file / response file by specifying the file with @_name_ in the command line.
Each line in the file is interpreted as command line argument, shell like escape sequences are not available.
The file can contain further @_name_ inputs. If the file cannot be the argument is used literally.
